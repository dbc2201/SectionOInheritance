    // 1. What is Inheritance?

    // Examples of Inheritance in real-life: An attribute, quality, trait, behaviour or property that is acquired by an
    // entity from another entity related to it.
    // 1. Your own physical appearance, i.e your physical attributes
    // height, color of skin, hair color, color of your eyes ... etc.
    // Inherited by YOU from YOUR PARENTS.
    // 2. The monetary inheritance, i.e money, a house, a car, some piece of land ... etc.
    // can be Inherited by YOU from YOUR PARENTS, when they wish to choose.

    // In Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can acquire
    // the properties (fields/variables) and methods of another class.
    // Entity --> Class
    // A Class (as an entity) will acquire the properties/methods of another entity (another class) related to it.

    // 2. How we can use Inheritance to re-use the code/software that is already developed and tested.

    // Software for re-using, can be:
    // 1. The Java SDK that is already developed and tested by the Java Developers.
    // 2. A software/program/code that is written by some developer(s) as an Open-Source Software.
    // Open-Source Software: We can take a look at the actual source code of the software
    // and we might be allowed to change the software.

    // 3. Observe when the 'extends' keyword is used.
    // 4. We will learn about a `super` class and a `sub` class.
    // 5. How we can access the members of the super class from the sub class.
    // 6. Constructor Hierarchy.
    // 7. Method Overriding, Dynamic Method Dispatch, Abstract Classes & Interfaces.
    // 8. How to model our programs with all the above concepts.
